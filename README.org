* About
This is a pneumatic press controller for automatic plastic cup sealing machine. The main function is to control a solid state relay which in turn controls a pneumatic solenoid valve in a set duration.
Temperature control uses an analog thermistor and is *not* included in this project repo.

** Modes
1. Mode 1
   This mode is to control the valve for a default amount of time of 3.7 seconds. The duration can be adjusted using the up/down button.
2. Mode 2
   Similar to the first mode but with the default time of 1 second.
3. Manual Mode / Stopwatch
   This  mode is to measure the duration of the start button is being pressed.
4. Counter
   This mode shows a counter for every time the start button is pressed in Mode 1 or Mode 2.
